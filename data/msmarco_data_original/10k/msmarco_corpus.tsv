If the material gets hot enough, hydrogen atoms begin fusing together to form helium atoms, and a star is born. A star will spend most of its life, called the main sequence phase, fusing hydrogen into helium. Click the image to see the animation. It's logical that a large nebula (one with a large amount of mass) will form a large star, and a small nebula will form a small star. However, in addition to a star's initial mass, a star's size also depends on the balance between the inward pull of gravity and the outward push of the energy produced by fusion. The entire sequence of a star's evolution can be described in terms of the changing balance between these two opposing forces.

1190	From these two formulas we can see that if the speed doubles, then the kinetic energy of an object becomes four times larger. Lets see an example: A car has a speed of 4 metres per second. Its kinetic energy is KE=1/2mass by speed squared, so its KE=1/2mass by 16 (since the square of 4 is 16). If the speed doubles and the car does 8 metres per second, its kinetic energy is: KE=1/2mass by 64 (since 8 squared gives us 64). If we divide 64/16 its 4. So we see that when speed doubles, the Kinetic Energy of an object becomes four times larger. Answer: Speed is distance over time (V=x/t).
